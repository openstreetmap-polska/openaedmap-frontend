# Open AED Map

This project shows [Automated External Defibrillators (AED)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_external_defibrillator) location on a map. Site is integrated with [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) reading data from OSM and allowing to add AED location to OSM.

This is a rewrite of [the first version](https://aed.openstreetmap.org.pl/) to React. Development is in progress.

Production environment: https://openaedmap.org \
Development environment: https://dev.openaedmap.org

# Development
## Gitflow

Branches:
- main - for prod environment
- dev - for dev environment

Create branch off of `dev` branch and when finished make PR back to `dev` branch.

Pushes to both branches result in auto deployment.

## Translating
We are using [Weblate](https://weblate.org) to manage translations.

If you want to help go to https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/openaedmap/ and start translating :)

If new language is added then create an issue or make a PR adding it to `src/i18n.ts` with the 2 letter language [ISO 639-1 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) and native name (this is going to be displayed in dropdown).

Language with multiple variants needs extra suffix e.g. zh-Hant for Traditional Chinese.

## Local environment

One way to set up is:
1. Clone repo and open terminal in the project directory
2. Install Node version 18 or use [Node version manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
3. Run `npm install`

Second way is if you are using VS Code and have Docker installed you can use devContainer extension.

Create .env file and put these variables there:
```
SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true
REACT_APP_VERSION=$npm_package_version
REACT_APP_OSM_API_URL=https://master.apis.dev.openstreetmap.org
REACT_APP_BACKEND_API_URL=https://backdev.openaedmap.org
REACT_APP_OSM_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=xXaPFXSLizLHuZzoLI1eebHncPdDdVH7nA917S9uFUo
REACT_APP_OSM_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET=vSfLjZquQ5xlcD9Lq9rhyDuH1ItpakgY5DW59WrRtHY
HOST=127.0.0.1
```

*Note: You can use Github Codespaces to develop.*

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run sprites`

Creates sprites from marker icons.

Make sure dev dependencies are installed.

#### `npm run css-build`

Build `sass/mystyles.scss` file into `src/mystyles.css` which is included in `index.tsc` and has the adjusted bulma css for the entire app.

Run this if changed e.g. navbar breakpoint or customized bulma further in `sass/mystyles.css`.

#### `npm run css-watch`

Watches `sass/mystyles.scss` for changes and runs `npm run css-build` if it detects any.
